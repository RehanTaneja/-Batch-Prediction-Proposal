**Title** - Batch-Prediction-Proposal

## **Summary**  
The goal of this project is to develop an optimized code sample demonstrating batch prediction with the Gemini APIs, specifically addressing long-context scenarios. A major challenge in this project is Context Window Overflow in Long Transcripts, where large transcripts exceed the API's token limit, leading to truncated inputs and loss of critical information.
To solve this, the implementation will use Hierarchical Chunking with Semantic Retrieval, an advanced context management technique that ensures only relevant transcript portions are processed. The key features include:

2. Batch Prediction Optimization ‚Äì Efficiently submitting multiple queries in a structured manner.

3. Long Context Handling ‚Äì Utilizing hierarchical chunking and semantic retrieval.

4. Context Caching ‚Äì Storing and reusing context across interconnected questions.

5. Output Structuring & Error Handling ‚Äì Ensuring robust execution and clear response formatting.

This project will provide a reusable code sample demonstrating best practices for handling large-scale input efficiently.

## **Benefits to the Community**  
Many AI applications require extracting information from extensive sources such as educational videos, legal documents, and research papers. The challenge arises when:

 - Large transcripts exceed API token limits, leading to truncation issues.

 - Repeated API calls increase costs when querying the same content multiple times.

 - Interconnected questions need context memory, making traditional stateless requests inefficient.

This project addresses these challenges with Hierarchical Chunking with Semantic Retrieval, ensuring that only the most relevant transcript sections are used for processing. This significantly reduces API costs while improving answer quality.

## **Deliverables**  
1. Batch Processing Module ‚Äì Implementing adaptive batch sizing and asynchronous API requests.

2. Hierarchical Chunking and Semantic Retrieval ‚Äì Intelligent transcript segmentation and context retrieval using sentence-transformers.

3. Context Caching Mechanism ‚Äì Combining in-memory caching (LRUCache) and persistent storage (SQLite/Redis).

4. Interconnected Question Handling ‚Äì Using conversation state tracking to improve multi-turn queries.

5. Structured Output and Error Handling ‚Äì Formatting responses clearly with timestamp linking and robust API error handling.

6. Comprehensive Documentation ‚Äì Including setup guides, sample queries, and best practices.
   
## **Technical Details**  
1. Batch Prediction Optimization üì¶

 - Implement batch submission of multiple queries to optimize API calls.

 - Use adaptive batch sizing to avoid exceeding API rate limits.

 - Implement asynchronous request processing (via asyncio, aiohttp) to parallelize API calls and minimize latency.

2. Hierarchical Chunking & Semantic Retrieval üìè

 - First-Level Chunking (Fixed Segments):

 - Split transcripts into overlapping fixed-length segments (e.g., 1000 tokens) to maintain continuity.

 - Second-Level Dynamic Retrieval (Semantic Search):

 - Convert transcript segments into embeddings using sentence-transformers.

 - Retrieve the most relevant transcript chunks based on query similarity.

 - Query-Specific Context Assembly:

 - Dynamically merge top-ranked chunks to fit within the API‚Äôs token limit.

3. Context Caching üíæ

 - Design an efficient caching mechanism using:

 - In-memory cache (LRUCache) for short-term reuse.

 - Persistent storage (SQLite, Redis) for long-term memory.

 - Implement a lookup mechanism to retrieve relevant previous responses.

4. Interconnected Question Handling üîó

 - Maintain a conversation state across multiple queries.

 - Implement context reattachment strategies for follow-up questions.

 - Improve response coherence by merging previous and current contexts before querying Gemini API.

5. Output Formatting & Error Handling ‚ú®

 - Provide structured, user-friendly responses, linking answers to relevant timestamps in the video.

 - Implement fallback mechanisms to handle API failures and timeouts.

 - Validate inputs to prevent malformed queries from reaching the
